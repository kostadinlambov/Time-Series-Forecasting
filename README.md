# Bitcoin Price Movement Prediction using CNN-LSTM Hybrid Model

## üìà Introduction to Time-Series Forecasting

Time series forecasting is the process of using historical data to predict future values based on trends, seasonality, and patterns in temporal data. Unlike traditional regression, time series forecasting considers the temporal structure where past observations influence future values. This project implements advanced deep learning techniques for financial market prediction.

**Key Techniques Explored:**
- **Statistical Models**: ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters), VAR
- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Regression
- **Deep Learning**: LSTM, CNN-LSTM Hybrids, Transformer-based models

## üî¨ Methodology and Research Design

This project evaluates the predictive performance of a **CNN-LSTM Hybrid** deep learning model for Bitcoin price movement prediction. The methodology integrates:

- **Technical Indicators**: Relative Strength Index (RSI), Simple/Exponential Moving Averages, MACD
- **Market Dynamics**: Seasonality patterns and underlying trend analysis
- **Neural Architecture**: Hybrid model combining CNN layers for feature extraction and LSTM layers for temporal sequence modeling
- **Target Prediction**: Binary classification for price direction (0=price falls, 1=price rises)

The research design focuses on creating a robust trading signal generation system using historical price data and technical analysis features.

## üìä Data Acquisition

**Data Source**: Coinbase API  
**Time Period**: January 2024 - January 2025 (1 year)
